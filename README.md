# PyTextUI

Minimal text box module for pygame.

PyTextUI has:
- Plain text box
- Scrollable text box
- Sequential text box (cycles through an array of lines when a key is pressed)
- Sequential JSON text box (cycles through lines specified in a JSON file when a key is pressed)
- Sequential scrollable text box (same as above, but scrollable)
- Sequential scrollable JSON text box (same as above, but with a JSON file instead of array)
- Multi-font box (can add lines to display with multiple fonts)

All text boxes can handle newline characters, unlike the base pygame module.
