# PyTextUI

Minimal text box module for pygame.

PyTextUI has four text boxes: regular text box, scrolling text box, sequential text box, and scrolling sequential text box.

All four text boxes can handle newline characters, unlike the base pygame module.

This repo also provides a sample main.py as well as sample JSON files demonstrating how to use each text box.
